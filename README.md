# BuildAHomeWorkstation
A tool for future developers

Objectives: Create two versions of an application that ultilizes the same back-end classes and data sources.

The point of this is to learn OOP, classes, and the basics of user interface.

Details:
1) Class Library
2) Console App
3) Windows Form app

  1) Class library-contains the objects and lists(inventory and shopping cart). The class library will be used in both versions of the Home Workstation Store application: console and GUI

  2) Console App- a program to ask the user to
        -pick items from inventory
        -place items into shopping cart
        -checkout and get a final price
  3) Windows Forms App- a graphical user interface that accomplishes the same goals as the console app
        -Create new items for the inventory
        -Places items into the shopping cart
        -Checkout and get a final price
